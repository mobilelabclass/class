## Design Assignment 📐

Design and build an AR app which augments ITP

* The app should be …  
    **a) Site-specific to the floor**  
    **b) Only has value for an ITP student / alumni / faculty**  
    **c) Interactive**  

* Consider the Aura of ITP, referencing Papagiannis  

  *One way to move beyond novelty and create meaningful experiences is to connect with the user contextually. “Aura” is another term that is linked to presence.*  

  *Aura can only exist if the individual can connect the object or place to his or her own understanding of the real world (such as an object or place) and the personalized context that you bring to it: your memories, your stories, and your experiences.*

* **Video document app usage**

* Reference [AR code kit](https://github.com/mobilelabclass/mobile-lab-ar-kit) for example code and app setup.
