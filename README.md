# Welcome to Mobile Lab 👩🏻‍🔬

Mobile Lab is a hands-on workshop where we explore the world beyond generic apps and push the boundaries of what’s possible on iOS hardware.

In this class we will cover both the design and technical elements that pertain to end-to-end mobile app development.

Topics will include augmented reality, the Internet of Things, new interfaces for musical expression, voice interaction, wearables, and others.
