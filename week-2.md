* Enroll in the Individual [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)  

  * Will need to provide basic information
  * Cost is $99/yr
  * Required for user beta testing which we will do next week
  * Required for submitting apps to the iTunes store 
  

## Design Assignment üìê

* **Lock Screen**  

  * Create original UI design
  * Create a new "Single View App" Xcode project for assignment.
  * Needs to have 6 sequential inputs
  * Needs to display status messages when appropriate, e.g. "Unlocked", "Try Again", etc.
  * Only 3 attempts possible before app needs to be reset/restarted
  * Look at [Unlock Screen Kit](https://github.com/mobilelabclass/mobile-lab-unlock-screen-kit) for reference and code
  * May also look at [UI Basic Kit](https://github.com/mobilelabclass/mobile-lab-ui-basic-kit) for reference and code on possible ui elements for app
  * Post github link of project on Slack #homework channel before the start of next class
